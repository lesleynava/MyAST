# CS 510 Project 3

Build a simple web app that draws Abstract Syntax Trees (AST). This is an individual project
The language to be parsed and displayed is `MicroML`, the one we covered in class.
Your language parser should be able to handle at least functions (topics from Chapter 4), preferably the higher order functions (Chapter 5).

## Requirement
- A web app (using dotnet) is required for this project. AST should be displayed on a web page.
- The web app should be able to parse the `MicroML` code.
- Use css to style the web page.
- The app is a single page web app. It should be able to take input from the user and display the AST on the same page.
- Use `git` for version control. Create your own repository on GitHub and push your code there. No GitHub Classroom for this project.
- Use AI tools are **allowed**. However, never copy the code from AI tools directly **without understanding** it.

## Submission
You only need to submit a link to your GitHub repository on Blackboard. Besides, a presentation section is required (see next line).
Presentation: your project will be checked by the instructor and/or GTAs on 05/06/2025 (standard), or on 05/08/2025 (late).
Each student needs to have 10+ commits for the whole project. The commits should be spread out over the project timeline.
Exclude configuration files from the commits by adding them to `.gitignore`.
Add a README file to the project. THe README file should include some screenshots of your app.
Add a license file to the project. Please use MIT license.
